# php-test-codes

Hello friends
This test app is little hard to understand, but it's made only for fun

there is a basic algorithm of game Rock,Paper,Scissors(Lizard,Spock)

but there is a php bot finds all pictures from internet(i know its needless but i just didnt wanted to be lazy and find a basic solution, 
Just wanted to improve some my php skills)


And you can see the project from: www.dwarf.ml
but there is some issues like its take little much time to load and you cant see the photos on final page, i think it's because of i'm 
using free Hosting and Domain

but if you want to see everything working perfectly, you can download it and run it on your computer

Thanks....
